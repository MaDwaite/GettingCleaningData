This data set includes activities, subjects, and data. 30 people were tested on
6 different activities using a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone to find data using
the accelerometer and gyrometer.

My data set gives a mean for each value of the mean and standard deviation
measurements, for each activity-subject combination. This way, a clean data set
is generated which follows each of the principles of tidy data:

	Each variable forms a column
	Each observation forms a row
	Each type of observational unit forms a table

It then writes the tidy data set to a text file separated by tabs.
